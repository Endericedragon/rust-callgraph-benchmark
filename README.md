# Rust Call-Graph Generator Benchmark

A benchmark for call-graph generators that analyze programs written in Rust.
This benchmark is a collection of hopefully all the possible ways to call a
function or a method within and across package boundaries in Rust.

This benchmark aims to enable call-graph generator implementers to assess
the soundness of call-graphs generated by their tools. It can also serve
as documentation of all the possible ways functions and methods may be called
in Rust code.
