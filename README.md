# Rust Call-Graph Generator Benchmark

A benchmark for call-graph generators that analyze programs written in Rust.
This benchmark is a collection of hopefully all the possible ways to call a
function or a method withing and across package boundaries in Rust.

This benchmarks aims to enable call-graph generator implementors to assess
the soundness of call-graphs generated using their tools.
