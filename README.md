# Rust Call-Graph Generator Benchmark

A benchmark for call-graph generators that analyze programs written in Rust. This benchmark is a
collection of hopefully all the possible ways to call a function or a method within and across
package boundaries in Rust.

This benchmark aims to enable call-graph generator implementers to assess the soundness of
call-graphs generated by their tools. It can also serve as documentation of all the possible ways
functions and methods may be called in Rust code.

## Benchmark Structure

The benchmark is built around the **main** package, which contains a single binary crate. The
benchmark is organized into several packages, each one containing a subset of the available ways to
call a function/method. These packages are **static_dispatch**, **dynamic_dispatch**,
**generics**, **function_pointers**, **conditionally_compiled** and **macros**.

All packages reside under the **src** directory accompanied by a [README](src/README.md) describing
each package and the purpose they serve.

Splitting the code across multiple packages and library crates allows for better code organization,
but also for opportunities to assess how call graph generators analyze and resolve cross-package
calls.

## Call-graph Generators Evaluations

The results of the call-graph generators evaluations we have conducted can be found under the
[evaludations directory](evaluations).
